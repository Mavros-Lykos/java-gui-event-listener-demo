# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in this project! ðŸŽ‰  
We welcome pull requests for **Hacktoberfest** and beyond.

There are some simple issues already open that you can pick up â€” feel free to comment on one to let us know youâ€™re working on it.  
If you spot something else that could be improved or have a new idea, itâ€™s totally fine to **open a new issue** and start a discussion before creating a PR.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork** this repository  
2. **Create a new branch** for your changes  
3. **Make your changes** (fix an issue or add something new)  
4. **Open a Pull Request** with a clear description of what you did  

Weâ€™ll review all submissions and merge eligible PRs marked with the `hacktoberfest-accepted` label.  
Even small improvements (like fixing typos, improving documentation, or cleaning up code) are welcome!

Happy contributing and happy Hacktoberfest! ðŸŒ±
