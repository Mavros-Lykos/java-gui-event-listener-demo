## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 8 or newer (the application runs on Java 8+)
- NetBeans (recommended) or Apache Ant (NetBeans build scripts are provided)

### Option 1: Run the Installer (Windows/macOS/Linux)
- Download the latest installer from the Releases page: [Releases](../../releases)
- Windows
   - Run the Windows installer (.exe).
   - Default install path: C:\Program Files\EventListenersDemo\
   - Launch from Start Menu (EventListenersDemo) or run "C:\Program Files\EventListenersDemo\EventListenersDemo.exe".
   - Uninstall via Settings > Apps > EventListenersDemo.
- macOS
   - Download the .dmg (or .pkg).
   - .dmg: drag EventListenersDemo.app to Applications. .pkg: follow the installer prompts.
   - If blocked by Gatekeeper, right-click the app and choose Open.
- Linux
   - Use the package for your distro if available (.deb/.rpm) or the AppImage.
   - AppImage: chmod +x EventListenersDemo*.AppImage && ./EventListenersDemo*.AppImage
   - DEB: sudo dpkg -i EventListenersDemo*.deb
   - RPM: sudo rpm -i EventListenersDemo*.rpm
- Current installers are bundled with JRE 21 for consistent behavior and HiDPI scaling—no separate Java installation required.
- Future releases may ship without an embedded JRE; in that case, install Java 8+ and run with your system Java.

### Option 2: Build and Run in NetBeans (recommended)
1. Open the project folder in NetBeans.
2. Build/Run using NetBeans (Run ▶). NetBeans uses the provided `build.xml` and project metadata.
3. NetBeans will produce a runnable JAR in `dist/` (ignored by Git).

### Option 3: Build with Ant (CLI)
If you have Ant installed, you can use the NetBeans build script:

```powershell
# From the project root (PowerShell)
ant clean jar

# Run the generated JAR
java -jar .\dist\javaGuiEventListenerDemo.jar
```

Notes
- If you run the JAR with an older Java (e.g., 8) on HiDPI displays and see small UI text, you can either run with a newer JDK (17+) or pass a UI scale VM option, for example:
```powershell
java -Dsun.java2d.uiScale=1.75 -Dflatlaf.uiScale=1.75 -jar .\dist\javaGuiEventListenerDemo.jar
```
   Adjust the scale value (1.25–2.0) to taste.

## 📚 Learning Guide

### How to Use This Application

1. **Start with Basic Events Tab**
   - Click buttons, check boxes, move sliders
   - Watch the event log to see which events fire
   - Notice the method names and parameters

2. **Explore Mouse & Key Events**
   - Move your mouse over the test area
   - Click, drag, and use the mouse wheel
   - Type in the text field to see keyboard events

3. **Test Component Events**
   - Focus on different text fields
   - Resize the window to see component events
   - Add and remove components dynamically

4. **Experiment with Window Events**
   - Create new test windows
   - Minimize, maximize, and restore windows
   - Switch between windows to see focus events

5. **Try Advanced Features**
   - Expand/collapse tree nodes
   - Edit table data
   - Interact with menus and popups
   - Monitor property changes

6. **Work with Text Events**
   - Edit text areas to see document events
   - Move the text caret
   - Use undo/redo functionality

### Understanding Event Listeners

**Event listeners follow the Observer pattern:**
1. A component (subject) maintains a list of listeners (observers)
2. When an event occurs, the component notifies all registered listeners
3. Each listener receives an event object with detailed information

**Example:**
```java
button.addActionListener(e -> {
    System.out.println("Button clicked!");
    System.out.println("Command: " + e.getActionCommand());
});
```

### Adapter Classes

Adapter classes provide empty implementations of listener interfaces, allowing you to override only the methods you need:

```java
// Instead of implementing all 5 MouseListener methods:
component.addMouseListener(new MouseAdapter() {
    @Override
    public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) {
        // Only implement what you need
    }
});
```

**Available Adapters:**
- `MouseAdapter`, `KeyAdapter`, `FocusAdapter`
- `ComponentAdapter`, `ContainerAdapter`
- `WindowAdapter`, `InternalFrameAdapter`
- `MouseMotionAdapter`
